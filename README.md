# C# Tutorial – Create a Street Fighter Game Demo in Windows Forms and Visual Studio

Welcome to the Street Fighter Demo Tutorial.  In this tutorial we will be making a small DEMO of the street fighter game using C#. There are a lot of techniques to use inside of this demo however I am really proud on how it turned out in the end. We used everything we have learned so far from the paint event series on MOO ICT and applying to make a simple demo of using RYU as the main character for this DEMO. In this demo we will be using multiple backgrounds and GIF images while making the animation interactive and responsive to the user inputs. All of the elements you see in this demo will be created from scratch. We are not using third party extensions, frameworks or games engine such as Unity, GODOT or Unreal to create this tutorial, everything will be done in the Windows Forms and with C# programming. Windows Forms template as we know is not made for something like this but by making it do something like this is an accomplishment. It will help any learner to hone in their game development skills. That’s because we manually creating all of the elements for this game and also we are going to go deep into the theory behind making it all work together step by step.
